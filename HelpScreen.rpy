    old "{color=#d8d2b8}{size=+10}Story And Free Roaming{/size}{/color}\n\nThe game has two 'sections': Free-Roaming Mode and Story Mode. \nThe reason for dividing them into sections is so, you as the player, can have full control over when you can 'relax' or wish to continue the story. Free-Roaming Mode lets you enjoy the more lewd and non-serious daily life of the DeLuca Family. Story Mode can be accessed via the 'Continue' button, allowing you to engage in the more serious storyline when you feel like it- especially if you'd rather pursue relationship building or some other aspect of the game. This does not mean that there can't be any lewd action in the story section nor that there won't be any serious story moment in free-roaming, but these are the exceptions- rather than the rule. Lastly, they are not separate entities, what happens in the story can affect free-roaming section and vice-versa."
